CODE From Prateek

Version 0:
- No arrows
- test code depends on attached cases (mat file)
- Haralick mex file is missing

Version 1: 
- Arrows functions and code commented
- Test is based on simple image matrix and mask

Version 2:
- Haralick mex file added
- Test haralick code added
- ComputeV.m is added (svd is performed separately)
- Code cleaned up
 
CODE FOR Prateek
 
Version 1:
- SVD as exe 
- slow 

Version 2:
- still slow 
- SVD C++ code modified
 
Version 3:
- SVD C++ code mexed
- Fast
 
Version 4: 
- All haralicks included
 
 
Ver - 5
- We noticed it doesn't work properly due to using atan in place of atan2, 
- Atan2 is now imported from C++ STD, mexed and used instead of the built in function
- We previously used atan to handle the sign discepancy from ComputeV
- Because both ComputeV and Atan_2 are implemented in C++, no need for using atan or the if statements after it.
- Haralick code updated and re-mexed
- Paths Case Directories are automatically detected
- parfor supported 
- Input haralick indices range is 1-13, outbut baseline image range is 0-12

Ver - 6 
- function compute_CoLlAGe2D accepts empty tumorMask passed to it
- Approximation step added after Atan_2 to make sure intermediate results are the same
- findOrientation code refined

Ver - 7 - 8/12/2017
- Code on bitbucket tag
- Data is classified to 4 groups now
- A spreadsheet describing patient groups for testing data is added
- User input for test params is GUI-based via input dialogs
- compute_CoLlAGe2D process the whole image with an additional boolean argument
- Three new helper functions were added: GetNameFromPath, IsTwoLevelMask, findInStringList
- Assertions function updated, renamed to AssertTestInput, and moved to /Tests
